                    <h3>A Vision Takes Shape</h3>
                    <p>The Wuxly movement ignited in 2012 when pro-football player James Yurichuk relocated from temperate British Columbia to Toronto's harsh winters. Searching for a high-performance parka for his girlfriend Daniela, newly arrived from Brazil, James found nothing that met his exacting standards for quality, ethics, and sustainability—prompting him to forge his own path.</p>
                    <p>Determined to create a solution, James partnered with master tailor Anthony Debartolo, leveraging Canada's rich manufacturing heritage and sustainable fabrics to craft the first Wuxly parka. This marked the beginning of a legacy—Canadian-made outerwear designed to deliver warmth, durability, and purpose, both in function and in values.</p>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <h3>Leadership & Vision</h3>
                    <p><strong>James Yurichuk, CEO & Founder</strong></p>
                    <p>Drafted 4th overall by the BC Lions in 2009, James showcased leadership and grit, contributing to a Grey Cup win that year. After joining the Toronto Argonauts in 2013, his on-field tenacity now fuels his strategic vision as Wuxly's leader.</p>
                    <p>In 2014, James earned the Jake Gaudaur Veterans' Award, recognizing his embodiment of Canadian veterans' values. His commitment to community shines through initiatives like anti-bullying campaigns, volunteer coaching, and advancing women's football leagues.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="story-section">
                    <h3>A Lasting Legacy</h3>
                    <p>Daniela's love for the parka sealed its success. James and Daniela later married and now raise their four children in Toronto, where Wuxly continues to thrive as a beacon of innovation and integrity in the textile industry.</p>
                    <p>What began as one person's quest to solve a personal problem has evolved into a global enterprise serving government, defence, and tactical organizations across NATO and allied nations.</p>
